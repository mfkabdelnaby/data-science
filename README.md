# Data Science Using Python

The main purpose that made me learn Python is to use it for Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) applications. Therefore, I am currently following the track of learning the different ML tools and functions in Python.

I am going to spend at least 1 hour a day to learn something new in this area from multiple sources, which will be immediately shared here.

Wish me luck :))
