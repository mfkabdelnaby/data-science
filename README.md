# Data Science Using Python

I am still a fresher in Python in general, and machine learing (ML) in particular, but here is my progress so far in this area. Have a look on the workbooks for the fundamental packages to learn ML

* [matlibplot](https://github.com/mustafarrag/data-science/blob/master/matplotlib.ipynb): A package used for plotting
* [numpy](https://github.com/mustafarrag/data-science/blob/master/numpy.ipynb): A package useful for dealing with arrays and matrices 
* [pandas](https://github.com/mustafarrag/data-science/blob/master/pandas.ipynb): A package useful for dealing with databases


Have fun learning with me! and update me of your feedback :)
